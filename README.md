# pythonSpotify
Using spotipy to collect users songs and putting them into different playlists
Note: The client_id and client_secret will need to be changed to your own based on your spotify profile. This code will not work right off the bat since I have reset the client_id for my own client_id. Using your own client_id and client_secret will allow you to modify your own account. The redirect_url will create a link from google.com which will need to be pasted into the terminal the first run.
